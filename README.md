# The Lyceum Project

## Why This Exists

Learning something new can be frustrating. You want to learn programming, math, or a new skill, but where do you start? Most courses are one-size-fits-all. They don't know what you already understand or where you're struggling. You might get bored with material that's too easy, or feel lost when it gets too hard.

We believe everyone deserves a personal tutor - someone who knows exactly what you need to learn next and can explain things in a way that makes sense to you. That's why we built The Lyceum Project.

## What We Built

The Lyceum Project is like having a really smart teacher who's available 24/7 and knows exactly how you learn best.

Here's what makes it different:

**It knows you.** Tell it what you want to learn and your current level. It creates a learning path that's perfect for you - not too easy, not too hard.

**It teaches by doing.** Instead of just reading or watching videos, you learn by actually doing things. Want to learn Python? You'll write real code. Learning about history? You'll work through interactive timelines.

**It's always there to help.** Stuck on something? Just ask. The AI tutor can explain concepts differently until they click for you.

**It uses the good stuff.** We pull from trusted sources like MIT's free courses, so you know you're learning from the best.

**It tracks your progress.** See how far you've come and what to tackle next. No more wondering if you're actually getting better.

## Who This Is For

- **Students** who want to learn at their own pace and need extra help
- **Working professionals** who want to pick up new skills but don't have time for long courses
- **Curious people** who love learning new things but get frustrated with boring textbooks
- **Anyone** who's tried online courses before but struggled to stick with them

## Our Mission

We want to make learning feel less like work and more like having a conversation with a really good teacher. Everyone should have access to personalized education that adapts to how they think and learn.

## What's Next

We're starting with the subjects people need most: math, programming, and writing. As more people use it, we'll add more topics and make it even smarter about how it teaches.

## About Us

Built by **Connor Love**, a Computer Science student at The Ohio State University who got tired of struggling through online courses that didn't fit how he learned.

Want to help make learning better for everyone? We'd love to have you join us.
