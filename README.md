# The Lyceum Project

## Overview
The Lyceum Project is an AI-powered learning platform designed to bring personalized, interactive education to everyone.  
It combines adaptive learning technology, intelligent tutoring, and hands-on practice to help learners truly understand subjects rather than just memorize content.

## Vision
Learning should feel like having a personal tutor—guided, engaging, and always available.  
The Lyceum Project seeks to redefine how people learn by merging adaptive technology, real-time AI assistance, and interactive practice tools in a single platform.

## What We’re Building
- A modern web platform built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**
- Personalized learning paths that adapt to each learner’s goals and skill level
- Real-time AI tutoring for on-demand help and step-by-step explanations
- Interactive “lab” exercises where users learn by doing
- A scalable foundation that supports both individual learners and institutional clients
