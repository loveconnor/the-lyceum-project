# The Lyceum Project

## Overview
The Lyceum Project is an AI-powered learning platform designed to bring personalized, interactive education to everyone.  
It combines adaptive learning technology, intelligent tutoring, and hands-on practice to help learners truly understand subjects rather than just memorize content.

## Vision
Learning should feel like having a personal tutor—guided, engaging, and always available.  
The Lyceum Project seeks to redefine how people learn by merging adaptive technology, real-time AI assistance, and interactive practice tools in a single platform.

## What We’re Building
- A modern web platform built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**
- Personalized learning paths that adapt to each learner’s goals and skill level
- Real-time AI tutoring for on-demand help and step-by-step explanations
- Interactive “lab” exercises where users learn by doing
- A scalable foundation that supports both individual learners and institutional clients

## Core Features
- **Adaptive Learning Paths:** Dynamic lessons that adjust to performance and learning style  
- **AI Tutor Assistance:** Context-aware explanations, hints, and guided problem-solving  
- **Interactive Labs:** In-browser coding, math, writing, and science environments  
- **Progress Tracking:** Personalized analytics to monitor mastery and improvement  
- **Multi-Modal Learning:** Text, visuals, and examples tailored to comprehension preferences  
- **Gamification (Planned):** Points, streaks, and achievements for engagement  
- **Community (Planned):** Forums and peer discussion groups to encourage collaboration

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend and Auth:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, API, Storage)  
- **AI Engine:** Integration with large language models for tutoring and adaptivity  
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend) and Supabase Cloud (backend)

## Goals
1. Develop an MVP focused on high-demand subjects like mathematics, programming, and writing  
2. Test and refine adaptive learning features through user feedback  
3. Build a full-scale, AI-driven learning ecosystem for both personal and professional growth  

## Future Roadmap
- Introduce educator dashboards and institutional analytics  
- Add enterprise SSO via WorkOS or similar integrations  
- Offer course completion certifications and skill badges  
- Continuously expand content and subject coverage
