# The Lyceum Project

## What is The Lyceum Project?
The Lyceum Project is an AI powered learning platform that helps you master any subject. It works like a personal tutor that is available twenty four seven. The goal is to make education personalized and interactive for everyone.

## What does it do?
This app creates custom learning paths based on what you want to learn. It uses artificial intelligence to generate lessons and exercises that fit your skill level.

Here is how it helps you learn:
- **Personalized Plans:** You tell the app what you want to learn, and it builds a step by step course just for you.
- **Smart Tutoring:** If you get stuck, an AI tutor explains concepts in simple terms and answers your questions.
- **Hands On Practice:** You learn by doing interactive labs and exercises, not just by reading or watching videos.
- **Trusted Sources:** It uses high quality content from trusted educational sources like MIT OpenCourseWare.
- **Progress Tracking:** You can see how much you have learned and keep track of your goals on a simple dashboard.
