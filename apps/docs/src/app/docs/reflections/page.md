Reflections reinforce learning by requiring learners to summarize, evaluate, and plan next actions after meaningful work.

## Reflection lifecycle

1. Trigger after path/lab milestones.
2. Capture structured and free-form responses.
3. Tag response quality and themes.
4. Surface in learner history and assistant context.

## Prompt design principles

- Keep prompts focused and actionable.
- Ask for evidence, not generic confidence statements.
- Include one forward-looking question per reflection.

## Data model considerations

- Preserve revision history.
- Keep response schema stable and versioned.
- Support retrieval by learner, path, and timeframe.

## Success metrics

- Completion rate after trigger.
- Response quality distribution.
- Correlation between reflection completion and module retention.
