Lyceum design should optimize clarity, momentum, and measurable learner progress.

## Principle 1: Clarity first

- Every screen should answer "what should I do next?"
- Use plain language over internal jargon.
- Error states must include corrective action.

## Principle 2: Progress over decoration

- Visual design should reinforce task hierarchy.
- Minimize friction between learning intent and execution.
- Keep interactions predictable across paths/labs/reflections.

## Principle 3: Assist, do not replace

- AI should coach and explain, not remove all effort.
- Prompts and suggestions should preserve learner agency.

## Principle 4: Instrument outcomes

- Design changes should be measurable.
- Define success metrics before shipping major UX updates.
